								<p>In this portfolio we will explore the journey of concept to prototype of an animatronic T-Rex scull, utilizing multiple cutting-edge technologies and techniques. Through out this module we have delved deep into the tool and methodologies we can use to help create this prototype. From using 3D scanning and motion capture to sculpting a 3D model using CAD software and haptic input devices. With the use of 3D printing, we can bring are virtual prototype to life and utilizing resin products to add the final touches.</a>.</p>
								<p>In this portfolio, our main goal is to create an animatronic T-Rex prototype using various advanced technologies we've learned about. We want to show how we can turn virtual ideas into real objects. By using 3D scanning, motion capture, CAD software, and more, we aim to make our T-Rex as detailed and lifelike as possible. Functionality was equally pivotal: the lower jaw's fluid motion, facilitated by a robust bearing joint within the skull, had to bear its weight effortlessly.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3> Introduction to design </h3>
								<p>During the design stage of our animatronic T-Rex project, we carefully planned and conceptualized our vision. Using computer-aided design (CAD) software, we created detailed digital models, refining the skull's shape and movement mechanisms within the jaw. We also considered practical aspects like size, weight, and power usage, testing prototypes to address any issues.</p>
								<h3> Jaw Bearings </h3>
								<p>In our animatronic T-Rex project, we paid special attention to designing the jaw bearings. These components were essential for enabling the smooth movement of the lower jaw, crucial for making our T-Rex look and function realistically. Using CAD software and 3D printing, we carefully crafted these bearings to support the jaw's weight while ensuring effortless motion. Their precise design allowed for natural opening and closing actions, just like a real T-Rex.</p>
								<h3> Design Considerations </h3>
								<p>In traditional bearing designs, spherical balls are typically enclosed within walls to retain them. However, for our project, we found this approach impractical and potentially problematic. 3D printing perfectly spherical balls posed challenges due to extreme overhangs during printing, resulting in wasted materials. To void this issue, we devised a unique solution, using rollers that gradually increased in diameter towards the ends. This roller design ensured smooth rolling motion without the risk of dislodging, resembling the mechanics of train wheels. We fashioned both the centre and outer casing of the bearings, optimizing functionality and efficiency in our design. </p>
								<h3> Design Challenges </h3>
								<p> Originally, the bearing concept had a 45-degree chamfered edges, but with printer constraints with regarding the ability to print excessive overhangs. This made us rethink the concept and the printability making us redesigned the bearing with a 60-degree cut-out, leaving a 30-degree chamfered edge. This change allowed the overhangs to print correctly, without requiring supports that would waste materials and energy. </p>
								<h3> Material choices and trade-offs </h3>
								<p> When choosing materials for our animatronic T-Rex, we considered several factors. When selecting materials for our animatronic T-Rex, we opted for Polylactic Acid (PLA), a commonly used and easy-to-work-with filament. Since the model was primarily intended for display purposes, extreme durability wasn't necessary. PLA was strong enough to support its weight during handling. However, if there was a risk of it being dropped, we'd have considered a tougher material like ABS. We used Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM), which creates visible layer lines on the model's surface. For our initial prototype, we went with a 0.2mm layer height. This choice saved on material and printing time, even though it resulted in visible lines on the print. But for the final bearing, we could go down to 0.08mm to make it smoother. PLA is a bioplastic made from plant starch, making it recyclable and compostable. It breaks down in less than 90 days in the right conditions. Plus, PLA emits fewer harmful fumes during printing compared to materials like ABS. That's why we chose PLA for all our prototype models. </p>
								<h3> Initial Design </h3>
								<p> We utilized Autodesk’s Fusion 360 as its parameter focused design capabilities we were able to have precise control over every section of the model. Furthermore, Fusion 360’s circular pattern feature streamlined the process, facilitating effortless duplication of the rollers in a symmetrical pattern. 
									The inner roller was created first. This roller as stated before is reduced from 45-degree chamber edges to a 30-degree chamber edges. We only need to design one half of the roller as it will be symmetrical about the z-axis. The smaller inner section was crafted to be precisely half the size of the chamfered section. This feature seamlessly blended into the main body, which comprised an inner circle and an outer ring. These components were extended to a height of 20mm and given a 30-degree chamfered edge. 
									As this bearing is designed to be press fitted into the cutouts in the side of the scull of the T-Rex, it needs to both be functional and durable. This will allow for the bearing to be replaced if broke, allowing for easy repairs without replacing the entire scull. The jaw element of the model will showcase a hexagonal shaft engineered to interface seamlessly with the internal bore of the bearing. This configuration ensures a superior grip, preventing any unintended slipping when attempting to move the jaw. Here's a breakdown of the shaft: </p>

								<h3> 3D modelling software </h3>
								<p>3D modelling is a software that help with the creating of a 3D digital representation of the model. This was crucial when designing the T-Rex skull model. With the ability to create accurate 3D models virtually we can adjust the size and dimensions of the model inside of the software. This allows us to be cost efficient as we can adjust the model inside of the software without having to print it and then visualising the mistakes that could have been made. Some examples of 3D modelling software tools include Blender, Sketch-up, and Fusion 360.
									In the process of creating the T-Rex model we utilized fusion 360 and blender. Next was to slice the model, this is to ensure it is ready for 3D printing, to slice the model Cura was used to create the layer-by-layer process that the 3D printer will have to follow. </p>
								<h3> 3D scanning hardware and software </h3>
								<p> 3D scanning technology allows for the creation of digital representations of physical objects or environments. It uses specialized software and hardware to gather relevant data points of the object or environment and create a virtual model.</p>
								<h4> Hardware </h4>
								<p> 3D scanning hardware comes in different types, these include laser scanners, structured light scanners, and photogrammetry-based scanners. Laser scanners emit laser beams to measure distances and capture the shape of objects with high precision. Structured light scanners project patterns onto objects and analyse deformations in the patterns to calculate the object's shape. Photogrammetry involves taking multiple photographs of an object from different angles and using software to triangulate points and reconstruct the object's geometry. Some scanners are handheld, allowing for flexibility in capturing objects of various sizes and shapes, while others are fixed and suitable for scanning larger objects or environments.</p>
								<h4> Software </h4>
								<p> Once the data is captured by the scanner, specialized software processes the information to generate a 3D model. This software aligns and merges scans, cleans up any imperfections, and creates a unified representation of the scanned object. Popular software options include Autodesk ReCap and Artec Studio.</p>
								<h3> Computer aided design (CAD) </h3>
								<p> Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a technology used to design and develop products, buildings, and other physical objects digitally. It utilizes multiple software’s that allow for designers to create detailed 2D and 3D models. CAD software offers a multitude of tools for drawing, editing, and dimensioning, this enables for precise changes to be made to the model. CAD is vital across many industries such as architecture, engineering, automotive, aerospace, and manufacturing, where it improves efficiency, accuracy, and innovation in the design process. 
									In our animatronic T-Rex project, we relied heavily on Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software and hardware to bring our creative vision to life with precision and efficiency. This allowed us to create detailed 3D models of the T-Rex skull, jaw mechanism, and other components. </p>
								<h3> Laser Cutting Hardware </h3>
								<p> Laser cutting hardware is typically used for precise cutting of various materials, these can include metals, plastics, wood, and fabrics. It utilizes the use of a high power and precise laser to cut, melt, or vaporise though materials, this creates a precise cut with high accuracy. Lazer cutting is not being used in this project as everything we are designing and making is 3-dimentinal. This is not suitable for a laser cutter as the model is not 2-dimensional and would requires intricate 4-dimentianal cutting. </p>
								<h3> Haptic input and 3D sculpting </h3>
								<p> Haptic input in 3D sculpting means using touch feedback devices to feel and shape digital models. These devices simulate the sensation of touching and sculpting virtual objects, allowing the user to feel the model as they manipulate it virtually. 
									In are animatronic T-Rex project, we utilized the use of haptic input devises to feel the shape of the model and make precise adjustments such as adding contours and recessed areas to the model. </p>
								<h3> Resin Comparison </h3>
								<p> When it came to material choices for our animatronic T-Rex project, we explored various resins to find the best fit for our needs. One type of resin we considered was epoxy resin, known for its high strength and durability. Epoxy resin is often used in applications where structural integrity is paramount, making it a strong contender for our project. Some other types of resins include </p>
								<h4> Polyester resin </h4>
								<p> Valued for its affordability and ease of use. Polyester resin is often chosen for projects where cost-effectiveness is a priority, although it may not offer the same level of strength and durability as epoxy resin. </p>
								<h4> Polyurethane resin </h4>
								<p> This resin is desired for its flexibility and impact resistance. Polyurethane resin is commonly used where a balance of strength and flexibility is required, making it suitable for components that may undergo stress or movement, such as joints in our T-Rex model. </p>
								<h4> UV resin </h4>
								<p> UV resin undergoes curing upon exposure to ultraviolet light and finds widespread application in 3D printing and jewellery crafting. Renowned for its rapid curing time and remarkable precision, UV resin excels in creating intricate details throughout project development.</p>
								<h3> 3D Printing Hardware and Workshop Facilities </h3>
								<p> In our animatronic T-Rex project, having access to top-notch 3D printing hardware and workshop facilities was crucial. These resources allowed us to turn our digital designs into physical prototypes quickly and accurately. There are several considerations that need to be taken to make sure that the model is printed correctly. </p>
								<h4> Material </h4>
								<p> When deciding what material that needs to be used there are some considerations, such as properties, printability, colour, strength, and quality. One of the most used 3D printing materials is Polylactic Acid (PLA), this is due to is ease of use, printability, and cost effectiveness. </p> 
								<h4> Overhangs and supports </h4>
								<p> To address overhangs and minimize the need for supports, we adjusted the design to incorporate gradual angles and supports where necessary. This ensured smoother printing and easier removal of supports, reducing post-processing time and material waste. </p>
								<h4> 3D printing hardware </h4>
								<p> When exploring 3D printing options, the choice of material is paramount. It's essential to consider that certain 3D printers may not be compatible with all materials. Additionally, the scale and size of the project play a significant role in selecting the appropriate 3D printer. Some printers may have limited base plate sizes, which can restrict the maximum size of the print. Therefore, careful consideration of both material compatibility and printer capabilities is necessary to ensure the successful execution of the project.</p>


								<h3> Challenges </h3>
								<p> Converting the intricate T-Rex model, especially the skull and jaw, into a parametric model within Fusion 360 posed a significant challenge. Fusion 360 relies on parametric modelling for precise dimensions and easy modifications. However, detailed models, especially those from sculpting, often have complex mesh structures. Adapting these meshes to Fusion 360's format demands substantial computational power. The sheer number of polygons in the T-Rex overwhelmed Fusion 360's conversion tools, making the process time-consuming and impractical. Consequently, features like the bearing shaft, its required negative space, and the set of teeth couldn't be directly modelled onto the jaw and skull. </p>
